    "# Model 2- LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is an advanced type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to overcome the challenges of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. It features memory cells with specialized gates—forget, input, and output—that enable it to selectively retain and update information over extended sequences. This capability makes LSTMs ideal for tasks requiring nuanced understanding of context over time, such as time-series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Key advantages include their ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, ensuring stable gradient flow during training, and their flexibility in handling variable-length sequences, which contributes to their widespread use in diverse fields of deep learning and artificial intelligence.\n"

    "Data preprocessing transforms raw data into a clean and usable format by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistent data scales through normalization or standardization. It also includes feature extraction and selection to enhance dataset quality. This step is essential for efficient and accurate data analysis or machine learning model performance."

    "2. **Splitting Data into Training, Testing, and Validation Sets**:\n",

    "4. **Reshaping Input Data to 3D**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: LSTM models in TensorFlow require input data in a three-dimensional format (`[samples, time steps, features]`), ensuring compatibility with the model’s architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training the Model**:\n",
    "   - **Reason**: Optimizes the LSTM model’s parameters on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) and evaluates its performance on the validation set (`X_val`, `y_val`) to monitor and improve generalization ability.\n",

    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "Model evaluation involves assessing a trained model's performance using various metrics to determine its effectiveness and generalization ability. Common metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, while regression tasks often use mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. The evaluation process typically includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model on the training set, and evaluating it on the test set to ensure the model performs well on unseen data. Cross-validation can also be used for more robust evaluation."
