# Fake Job Posting 

## Introduction
This comprehensive project report delves into the development and evaluation of advanced machine learning models for the detection of fake job postings. By leveraging a dataset of real and fraudulent job advertisements, the team has implemented and compared three distinct approaches: a Logistic Regression model, an LSTM-based model, and a BERT-based model. The primary objective of this project is to create robust and reliable tools that can effectively identify and prevent the proliferation of fake job postings, thereby protecting job seekers and maintaining the integrity of the hiring process.

## Purpose
The proliferation of fake job postings has become a significant challenge in the job market, with job seekers often falling victim to scams and employers struggling to maintain the credibility of their hiring practices. This project aims to address this issue by developing and evaluating machine learning models that can accurately classify job postings as either real or fake. By providing effective tools for detecting fraudulent job advertisements, this project seeks to empower job seekers, employers, and recruitment platforms to identify and mitigate the impact of fake job postings.

## Approach
The project follows a systematic approach to develop and evaluate the machine learning models:

 **Data Collection**: The team has gathered a comprehensive dataset of real and fake job postings, which serves as the foundation for model training and evaluation.

 **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is meticulously cleaned and prepared for model training, ensuring that the input features are in a suitable format for the various machine learning techniques.

 **Model Development**: Three distinct models are implemented and trained on the preprocessed data:
 
- **Logistic Regression (LR) Model**: Implementing a logistic regression model to classify job postings as real or fake.
- **LSTM Model**: Developing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to capture the sequential nature of text data for job posting classification.
- **BERT-Based Model**: Leveraging the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and fine-tuning it on the job posting dataset.

**Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is assessed using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine their effectiveness in detecting fake job postings.

 **Comparison and Conclusion**: The results of the three models are compared, and insights are drawn about the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, ultimately leading to recommendations for future work and practical applications.

 ## Methodology

### Logistic Regression (LR) Model
The Logistic Regression model provides a simpler approach to classifying job postings as real or fake. The key steps involved in this model are:

**Data Preprocessing**:
- The job posting text is converted into numerical representations using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

**Model Training**:
- A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set.
- The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used to train the model.

**Model Evaluation**:
- The performance of the Logistic Regression model is evaluated on the testing set.
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance.


### LSTM Model
The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model leverages the sequential nature of text data to classify job postings. The key steps involved in this approach are:

**Data Preprocessing**:
- The job posting text is tokenized, and the tokens are converted into numerical representations using an embedding layer.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

**Model Architecture**:
- An LSTM layer is used to capture the sequential information in the text data.
- Dense layers are added on top of the LSTM layer to classify the job postings as real or fake.

**Model Training**:
- The LSTM model is trained on the training set.
- The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used to train the model.

**Model Evaluation**:
- The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated on the testing set.
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance.

### BERT-Based Model
The BERT-based model leverages the power of the pre-trained BERT model to classify job postings as real or fake. The key steps involved in this approach are:

**Data Preprocessing**:
- The job posting text is tokenized, breaking it down into individual words or subwords.
- The tokenized text is then converted into numerical representations using the BERT tokenizer, which assigns unique IDs to each token.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.


**Model Training**:
- The pre-trained BERT model is used as a starting point, and a classification layer is added on top of the BERT model.
- The model is fine-tuned on the job posting dataset, allowing it to learn the specific patterns and characteristics of real and fake job postings.
- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

**Model Evaluation**:
- The performance of the BERT-based model is evaluated on the testing set.
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's ability to correctly classify job postings.


## Comparison of Models**
The **BERT-based model** demonstrates the highest performance among the three approaches, suggesting that it is the most effective at classifying job postings as real or fake. The BERT model's advanced natural language processing capabilities, which allow it to understand the contextual and semantic relationships in the text data, contribute to its superior performance.

While the **LSTM model** also shows promising results, it falls short of the BERT-based model's performance. The LSTM model's strength lies in its ability to capture the sequential nature of text data, but the BERT model's holistic understanding of language appears to be more effective for the specific problem of fake job posting detection.

The **Logistic Regression model**, being a simpler approach, provides a viable alternative, especially in scenarios where computational resources or model complexity may be a concern. However, it does not match the performance of the BERT-based and LSTM models.

## Future Scope and Use Cases
**1. Future Work**: The project team recommends further improving the BERT-based model by fine-tuning it on larger datasets and exploring additional techniques to enhance its performance. Additionally, investigating ways to improve the LSTM model's performance, such as incorporating attention mechanisms or using more advanced architectures, could lead to significant advancements in the field of fake job posting detection.

**2. Practical Applications**: The BERT-based model, being the most effective among the three approaches, should be prioritized for implementation in real-world applications. By integrating this model into job search platforms, recruitment systems, and employment-related services, the team can effectively detect and prevent the proliferation of fake job postings, ultimately protecting job seekers and maintaining the integrity of the hiring process.

This comprehensive project report provides a detailed analysis of the three machine learning models developed for the detection of fake job postings. The BERT-based model emerges as the superior approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately classifying job postings as real or fraudulent. The insights and recommendations presented in this report can serve as a valuable guide for future research and practical applications in the field of job posting fraud prevention.


## Conclusion
The BERT-based model outperforms the Logistic Regression (LR) model in terms of accuracy for the task of detecting fake job postings. 
The superior performance of the BERT-based model can be attributed to its ability to capture contextual information and semantic relationships within the text data, which is crucial for accurately distinguishing real job postings from fake ones.
While the Logistic Regression model provides a simpler and viable approach, the BERT-based model demonstrates more effectiveness in this specific task of fake job posting detection.
