The high precision and recall for both classes (fake and real news) indicate the model's robustness and reliability in correctly identifying fake news. The CNN's superior performance metrics highlight its effectiveness and efficiency in distinguishing between fake and real news. Therefore, the CNN model stands out as the best choice for fake news detection among the evaluated models."
