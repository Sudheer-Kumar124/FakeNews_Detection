    "# Model 1- Logistic regresssion \n",
    "**Logistic regression** is a foundational statistical model used primarily for binary classification tasks, where it predicts the probability of an event occurring based on input variables. Despite its name, it's a linear model that fits data to a logistic (sigmoid) function, transforming the output into a probability score between 0 and 1. This makes it straightforward to interpret, as the predicted probability directly indicates the likelihood of an instance belonging to a specific class. Logistic regression is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets, and it doesn't assume a particular distribution of input variables like Gaussian assumptions in other classifiers. It's commonly applied in scenarios such as predicting customer churn, identifying spam emails, or detecting fraudulent transactions. While logistic regression's linear decision boundary can be limiting in capturing complex relationships, its simplicity, interpretability, and robust performance as a baseline model make it indispensable in both statistical analysis and machine learning applications."

    "## 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Data preprocessing transforms raw data into a clean and usable format by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistent data scales through normalization or standardization. It also includes feature extraction and selection to enhance dataset quality. This step is essential for efficient and accurate data analysis or machine learning model performance."

The data is then split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall. Hyperparameter tuning can be performed to optimize the model. This process helps create a robust predictive model that can effectively classify binary outcomes."

    "The logistic regression model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.9757199322416714, or approximately 97.57%, on the test set. This means the model correctly classified 97.57% of the instances in the test data.\r\n",

    "For class 0, the model has very high precision (98%), meaning 98% of the instances predicted as class 0 are actually class 0. The recall is also very high (100%), indicating that the model correctly identifies all the actual class 0 instances. The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is 0.99, reflecting the model's excellent performance for class 0.\r\n",

This suggests that while the model correctly identifies most of the class 1 instances when they are predicted as such, it misses a significant portion of the actual class 1 instances.
