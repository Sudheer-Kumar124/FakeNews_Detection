Common metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, while regression tasks often use mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. The evaluation process typically includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model on the training set, and evaluating it on the test set to ensure the model performs well on unseen data. Cross-validation can also be used for more robust evaluation."
