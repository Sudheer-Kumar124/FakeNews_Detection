    "### Evaluation and Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** The LSTM model achieved a high test accuracy of 98.46%, which is comparable to the accuracy of the Random Forest model and better than that of the Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models.\n",
    "- **Loss:** The test loss for the LSTM model is 0.0566, indicating a strong performance.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** The LSTM model shows some variability in training, as seen in the third epoch with a spike in loss, but overall maintains high accuracy and low loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Verdict:\n",
    "The **Random Forest model** still stands out as the best-performing model based on the RMSE, MAE, and R² score metrics. However, the **LSTM model** also performs exceptionally well, especially in terms of accuracy. If the primary goal is accuracy, the LSTM model is highly competitive. If considering overall error metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²), the Random Forest model remains the best choice."
